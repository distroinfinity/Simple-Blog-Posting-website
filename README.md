# Simple-Blog-Posting-website
A blogging site created with Django

I have implemented a custom Django user is this project. The "account" app holds all the necessary files and code related to custom user creation,the "blog" and "personal" app together make up the basic blog elemnt of the website and the homepage,user creation/registration pages etc.  
"mysite" is the main app which contains the "settings.py" file.
"media_cdn","static_cdn" and static are just static files holding directories.

The "requirements.txt" file contains a list of necessary packages to run this project.
